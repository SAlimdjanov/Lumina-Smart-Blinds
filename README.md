# Lumina Smart Blinds Capstone Project

Embedded software for ENGPHYS 4A06 - Engineering Physics Design and Synthesis Project (Fall 2022 - Winter 2023)

## Setup Notes

After cloning the repository and opening it in Visual Studio Code, install the following extensions if you haven't already:
- C/C++
- C/C++ Extension Pack
- C/C++ Themes
- PlatformIO IDE
- Clang-Format
- Doxygen Documentation Generator
- GitLens

You will also have to install the [LLVM Compiler](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-15.0.1/LLVM-15.0.1-win64.exe) to use Clang-Format, an automatic code formatter for C/C++. After installing, place the path of the executable file under the `Clang-format: Executable` setting under the Clang-Format extension settings in Visual Studio Code. For example:

`D:/LLVM/bin/clang-format.exe`

If all is successful you should see the code format itself when you save changes to a file.
